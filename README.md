<p>STEPs4GROWTH, led by NCA&T, will expand Clean Energy (CE) sectoral partnerships champions to establish a National CE RAP HUB. A CE RAP HUB “Framework model” (Fig. 1, discussed later) will be hosted in NC and will anchor a national Community of Practice (CoP) with CE workforce initiatives across the country (>5 state CE workforce development programs will collaborate with NC). The CE sub-sectors of the RAP HUB will include, in part: Electric Vehicles; Battery Technology; EV Charging Stations; Solar Energy; Energy Efficiency (EE); Advanced Materials/Mfg; Grid modernization; and Grid Cybersecurity. A CE RAP HUB workforce training and employment system will be established for workers at all levels and will include accessibility programs for autistic professionals. RAP enhancement, implementation, and expansion Phases will include contributions from: Industries; Energy Consortia; CommunityCollege training partners; Workforce Development Boards; Worker Unions; Regional Training Centers; Chambers of Commerce; Universities; High Schools; and other worker-support groups.</p>

### problem
 <p>Climate Change is driving change across the planet today. There is growing concern for the Earth, and states including NC have begun to take action to curb the worst impacts of Climate Change. These impacts include rising temperatures, stronger storms, and more recovery resources spent each year to deal with negative impacts. Supported by President Biden’s clean energy vision: 50% carbon-emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050; and NC Governor Cooper’s EOs/Bills 80, 143, 218, 951, and 246 focused on energy and climate change - the time to act is now. The Clean Energy sectors and sub-sectors mentioned above are rapidly growing and expect to grow faster in the future, and there are not sufficient trained workers to fill the demand. STEPs4GROWTH is poised to address the severe CE worker shortage across NC and the US. Federal investment in Clean Energy is accelerating through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) ($62B to attack climate change7 ). Additionally, the DOE announced, 13Jan2022, its “Clean Energy Corp” that will hire 1000 new employees7 . CEDS (Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy) reports for the 3 STEPs4GROWTH focus regions 6,8-11; and recent NC comprehensive economic development strategies, plans and jobs reports12-19,74-79 were analyzed. Key targeted NC industry sectors include “clean energy, aerospace, and automotive (EV) manufacturing.” The NC State Energy Plan (Oct2019) made a strong recommendation to build apprenticeship workforce programs for Clean Energy. In January 2022, NC reported ~24k new jobs and $10 billion in capital investment with the First in Talent workforce strategy.</p>
